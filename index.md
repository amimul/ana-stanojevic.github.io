## Project proposal

**About the project** 

A simple walk on any beach, anywhere, and the plastic waste is present. Tons of plastic debris (which by definition are waste that can vary in size from large containers, fishing nets to microscopic plastic pellets or even particles) is discarded every year, everywhere. All people around the world are to smaller or bigger extent affected by this problem [e.g. through food chains]. Our target audience are plastic consumers, governments, industry, etc. We are inspired by previous research of one of our teammates, who investigated marine plastic pollution. Moreover, expedition dataset which we encountered is interesting and descriptive. Lastly, the problem of pollution is very important and we would like to contribute, by highlighting the dynamics of plastic pollution over the world. User of interactive visualisation should be able to inspect the global and local statistics of ocean pollution, as well as get an impression of importance of the topic. 

**Data set description** 

There are two separate datasets on marine plastic pollution dynamics. First one describes density of different "plastics" [plastic peaces of different size] at certain geographical location at a particular time point. Second data set is a collection of .csv files. One .csv file represents the spreading of plastic waste from referent geographical location. E.g. if a peace of plastic was thrown on the cost of China, we can follow its path in the seas over time.
